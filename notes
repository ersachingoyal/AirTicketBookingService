here we have also used a npm morgan package for logging mechanism
for our booking model we have flightid because a booking will be pointing to a flight and userid because a booking will
be belonging to an user

to modify an existing model we can run this command npx sequelize migration:create --name modify_bookings_add_new_fields,
this will create just a migration and there we can add the fields we need to add to our existing model and do a db migrate,
we need to add those same fields in the old model js file also


we will make call to reminder service from here to send the mails, but the mail sending is not urgent, so we need not to send the mails
immediately , so we will send a msg queue in between both of these , booking service will publish a msg to the queue and reminder service
will subscribe to the msg whenver its up and having the bandwith

for this we will use rabbitmq - we need to install this from there site and to connect rabbitmq with node we will
use amqplib -> npm i amqplib
