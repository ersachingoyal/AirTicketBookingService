here we have also used a npm morgan package for logging mechanism
for our booking model we have flightid because a booking will be pointing to a flight and userid because a booking will
be belonging to an user

to modify an existing model we can run this command npx sequelize migration:create --name modify_bookings_add_new_fields,
this will create just a migration and there we can add the fields we need to add to our existing model and do a db migrate,
we need to add those same fields in the old model js file also
